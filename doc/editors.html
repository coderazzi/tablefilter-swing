  <h1>Filter Editors</h1>

  <p>
    <span class='mark'>TableFilter</span> provides two types of filters; 
    based on text parsing or based on single user choices. 
    Users can create additional filters, based on the interface 
    <a href='api/com/byteslooser/filters/gui/ITableFilterEditor.html'>ITableFilterEditor</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    All the editors available in the library are placed in the package
    <a href='api/com/byteslooser/filters/gui/editors/package-summary.html'>com.byteslooser.filters.gui.editors</a>.
  </p>

  <p>The available editors are:
  <ul>
    <li><a href='#TextChoiceFilterEditor'>TextChoiceFilterEditor</a>: 
      this is the default editor, corresponds to the mode BASIC in the 
      <span class='mark'>TableFilterHeader</span>.</li>
      
    <li><a href='#TextFilterEditor'>TextFilterEditor</a>: 
      this is an editor equivalent to the previous one, but with smaller size, 
      corresponds to the mode SLIM in the <span class='mark'>TableFilterHeader</span>.</li>
      
    <li><a href='#ChoiceFilterEditor'>ChoiceFilterEditor</a>: 
      this is an editor where the user can only select an already 
      provided filter choice; it is not directly available in the 
      <span class='mark'>TableFilterHeader</span></li>
      
    <li><a href='#TableChoiceFilterEditor'>TableChoiceFilterEditor</a>: 
      this is an editor where the user can only select an already provided 
      filter choice; it corresponds to the mode CHOICE in the 
      <span class='mark'>TableFilterHeader</span>.</li>      
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    The normal way to use these editors is under the 
    <a href='header.hmtl'>TableFilterHeader</a>, but they can be used on their 
    own as well, as is explained in the 
    <a href='standalone editors section'</a>.
  </p>

  <h2><a name='TextChoiceFilterEditor'>TextChoiceFilterEditor</a></h2>

    <p><img src="images/examplefpb.png" class="centered"></p>

    <p>
      This is the editor that <span class='mark'>TableFilter</span> uses by 
      default. Its displayed as a 
      <a href='http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JComboBox.html?is-external=true'>JComboBox</a>, 
      where the user can enter manually the expression to parse.
    </p>

    <p>
      The editor is not responsible to perform the parsing, which is delegated to a
      <a href='api/com/byteslooser/filters/parser/IFilterTextParser.html'>IFilterTextParser</a>
      instance. Users can define their own parsers, or use the 
      <a href='parsers.html'>default one</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The editor places in the combobox the last valid parsed expressions, 
      facilitating the input of multiple filters. It also supports the concept 
      of predefined choices, which are shown to the user together with the 
      last used expressions. When used in a 
      <span class='mark'>TableFilterHeader</span> component, in table columns 
      with Boolean or Enumeration types, the different boolean or
      enumeration values are automatically setup as editor' choices.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a parsing editor, it can compose as complex filter expressions as 
      the associated parser support, but it supports little customization. Its 
      <a href='api/com/byteslooser/filters/gui/editors/TextChoiceFilterEditor.html'>interface</a> 
      includes a few methods to handle the historic / choice values:
      <ul>
        <li><a href='api/com/byteslooser/filters/gui/editors/TextChoiceFilterEditor.html#setHistoricLength(int)'>setHistoricLength</a> 
          and 
          <a href='api/com/byteslooser/filters/gui/editors/TextChoiceFilterEditor.html#addToHistoric(java.lang.String)'>addToHistoric</a>
          control the historic values.</li>
        <li>
          <a href='api/com/byteslooser/filters/gui/editors/TextChoiceFilterEditor.html#suggestChoices(java.lang.String...)'>suggestChoices</a>
          supports customizing the choices that are always shown to the user.</li>
      </ul>
    </p> 


  <h2><a name='TextFilterEditor'>TextFilterEditor</a></h2>

    <p><img src="images/examplefp.png" class="centered"></p>

    <p>
      This editor matches most of the functionality exposed by the 
      <a href='#TextChoiceFilterEditor'>TextChoiceFilterEditor</a>,
      but using a 
      <a href='http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JTextField.html?is-external=true'>JTextField</a>,
      which implies an smaller size.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is also still able to support historic values, showing them in a contextual menu.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Therefore, its
      <a href='api/com/byteslooser/filters/gui/editors/TextFilterEditor.html'>interface</a> 
      is very similar; it only lacks the option to provide prefixed choices
    </p>

    

  <h2><a name='ChoiceFilterEditor'>ChoiceFilterEditor</a></h2>

    <p>
      This editor is not directly available in the 
      <span class='mark'>TableFilterHeader</span>, which uses better the 
      <a href='#TableChoiceFilterEditor'>TableChoiceFilterEditor</a>, 
      an specialization of the ChoiceFilterEditors which is automatically 
      prepopulated with the contents of the table's column.
    </p>

    <p><img src="images/examplefc.png" class="centered"></p>

    <p>
      In this editor, the user cannot provide an expression, just choosing 
      among  the provided filters. Its main advantage against the parsing 
      editors is its support for better customizations. For example, the 
      figure above has this editor showing the different country flags. 
      Lacking this visual approach, the user would be forced to use some 
      string  representation for the icons.
    </p> 

    <p>
      This visual customization is directly provided by the 
      <a href='http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/JComboBox.html?is-external=true'>JComboBox</a>
      class, through the 
      <a href='http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/ListCellRenderer.html'>ListCellRenderer</a>,
      although the ChoiceFilterEditor defines the more specific 
      <a href='api/com/byteslooser/filters/gui/editors/ChoiceFilterEditor.IRenderer.html'>IRenderer</a>
      interface to do the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      This editor is not only interesting when the associated object has 
      a visual rich representation, like the icons in the previous figure, 
      but also when the choices are prefixed, like in the image below, where 
      the user can choose exams whose qualifications match given ranges:
    </p>

    <p><img src="images/examplefc2.png" class="centered"></p>

    <p>
      This second customization is provided through the  
      <a href='api/com/byteslooser/filters/gui/editors/ChoiceFilterEditor.IChoice.html'>IChoice</a> 
      interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      To use this editor directly, the user must provide all the available 
      choices, using the defined 
      <a href='api/com/byteslooser/filters/gui/editors/ChoiceFilterEditor.html'>interface</a>. 
      It supports the concept of <b>other choices</b>, which is simply an 
      additional choice whose selection  implies the negation of any other 
      shown choice. In most cases, the user will use the 
      <a href='#TableChoiceFilterEditor'>TableChoiceFilterEditor</a>,
      where the choices are automatically extracted from the table's values.
    </p>


  <h2><a name='TableChoiceFilterEditor'>TableChoiceFilterEditor</a></h2>

    <p>
      The images above, for the 
      <a href='#ChoiceFilterEditor'>ChoiceFilterEditor</a> describe equally 
      the  TableChoiceFilterEditor. This is an specialization of the 
      ChoiceFilterEditor that provides automatically the initial choices, 
      and with an extended
      <a href='api/com/byteslooser/filters/gui/editors/TableChoiceFilterEditor.html'>interface</a>, 
      to define how to extract choices from the table.
