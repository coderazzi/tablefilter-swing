    <h3>Version 3.1.1 ( 13th May 2010 ) </h3>
    	<ul>
    		<li>
    		    Solved bug: autoOptions / autoSelection not propagated
    		    properly from the FilterSettings.     			
    		</li>
    		<li>
    			Updated example to use autoOptions by default.    			
    		</li>
		</ul>

    <h3>Version 3.1.0 ( 10th May 2010 ) </h3>
    	<ul>
    		<li>
    			There are no code changes from 3.0.1; this release was required due to the
    			mavenization of the project. It is now available directly from the
    			central maven repositories.    			
    		</li>
		</ul>

    <h3>Version 3.0.1 ( 5th May 2010 ) </h3>
    	<ul>
    		<li>
    			The filter's background and foreground colors can be defined directly in
    			the <a href="api/net/coderazzi/filters/gui/FilterSettings.html">FilterSettings</a> 
    			class.    			
    		</li>
    		<li>
    			The header's background color is not defined anymore as the table's header, but
    		    averaged with the table's background. In some platforms, the look is much nicer.
    		</li>
    		<li>
    		    The arrow to show the popup looks now the same if the filter is disabled or
    		    if the popup cannot be shown -because there is no entries to show-.    		    
    		</li>
    		<li>
    		    The arrow to show the popup is now placed shifted to the bottom.   		    
    		</li>
    		<li>
    			Integrated <a href="api/net/coderazzi/filters/parser/Types.html">Types</a>'s parser 
    			into the <a href="api/net/coderazzi/filters/gui/FilterSettings.html#types">FilterSettings</a>
    			class.    			
    		</li>
    		<li>
    		    Solved error comparing dates.   		    
    		</li>
    		<li>
    		    Solved error where the focus would remain on the editor, even if disabled.   		    
    		</li>
    		<li>
    		    Whole build process has moved to <a href='http://ant.apache.org/'>ant</a> 		    
    		</li>
		</ul>

    <h3>Version 3.0.0 ( 28th April 2010 ) </h3>
    	<ul>
    		<li>
    			Version 3.0.0 is a major rewriting of the library. It is mostly focused to the Gui, 
    			but it affects to many internal aspects. In general, it should be much simpler 
    			using the library, for the programmer and for the user. The major changes are 
    			listed below.
    		</li>
    		<li>
    			<span class='mark'>Look and feel</span><br>
    			Previous versions of TableFilter could look -depending on the platform and look and feel-, like:
    			
    			<img src="images/old-a.png" class="centered">
    			
    			The inconsistencies would appear when the user mixed different types of editors 
    			on the same header. The most usual headers were implemented using combo boxes, 
    			which could be editable or not. As far as the platform would show both kind of 
    			editors in a similar way, the appearance was fine. 
    			In Windows XP, for example, both look almost the same, although the background 
    			is different; but on Os X, it would look as bad as:
    			
    			<img src="images/old-b.png" class="centered">
    			
    			Even if the user didn't mix editor types, the editable combo box looks here 
    			pretty bad (is the age and male columns in the figure).
    			<br>The new version solves these inconsistencies by implementing its own 
    			editor component, looking as:
    			
    			<img src="images/version3.png" class="centered">
    			
    			Where there were before 4 types of editors -plus any custom creation by 
    			the user-, there is now only one, covering the whole functionality provided 
    			before by the 4 types:
    			<ul>
				  <li>Each editor has its own history, which can be disabled.</li>
				  <li>In addition to historic items, it is possible to specify options for each editor, or even
				      obtaining these options automatically from the table's content.</li>
				  <li>The editor's content can be edited, and autocompletion is built-in.</li>
				  <li>An editor can be defined as non editable. In this case, the input can only match one of
				      the existing options.</li>
				  <li>The editor's content can use custom renderers, like in the following figure.</li>
			   </ul>
			   
			   <img src="images/version3-b.png" class="centered">
  
			  There is no need anymore of casting editor types to use the functionality associated to
			  each type of editor. There is a disadvantage: users cannot define anymore their own editor
			  components. 
    		</li>
    		<li>
    			<span class='mark'>Custom types</span><br>
    			
    			Previous versions required the usage of the interface 
				  <span class='mark'>net.coderazzi.filters.parser.ITypeBuilder</span>
				  to handle non primitive types, including Dates. Its only method, 
				  <span class='mark'>parse</span>, would produce an Object
				  from a String, very much as the standard <span class='mark'>java.text.Format</span> class does.
				  While writing the new version, I uncovered some errors on the initial implementation,
				  realizing that the filtering requires, not only parsing provided text, but also to format
				  objects into Strings.
  
			  <br>What this means is that the <span class='mark'>net.coderazzi.filters.parser.ITypeBuilder</span>
			  type is now gone, replaced by usage of <span class='mark'>java.text.Format</span> instances.
    		</li>
    		<li>
    			<span class='mark'>Filter parser</span><br>
			
			  The original version of TableFilter allowed the definition of complex expressions. For 
			  example, for a table having a column called age and other called name, the user could enter
			  an expression such as:
			  
			   <pre>age &gt; 25 & age &lt; 30 & name ~ Fred*</pre>
			   
			   This is very convenient, even if it could be misleading: the previous expression could be
			   entered on any column, not just on the age or name columns. But the main problem is that the
			   parser was not very configurable, defined quite exotic operators, 
			   and included some obvious errors -using of spaces, for example,
			   would normally lead to problems-.
			   
			   <br>In version 3.0, the distributed parser only allows basic filtering expressions, without 
			   variable names. The original parser could still work -the interface is mostly the same-, but
			   I have preferred to discontinue it. If it were still needed, I will favor implementing a
			   correct parser instead.
			   
			   <br>And, of course, the user can still use its own parser, as the interface has only slightly
			   changed.
       		</li>
    	</ul>

    <h3>Version 2.2.0 ( 12th April 2010 ) </h3>
      <ul>
       <li>
	       This version reintroduces compatibility with Java 5, temporarily excluded on version 2.1, 
	       although not all features are available in the old Java version; more specifically, autoselection
	       will not be supported under Java 5. In addition, many tests for the Java 5 version have been 
	       rewritten, as they contained important bugs
	   </li>
       <li>
	       Concerning Java 6, this release solves a minor bug, as not all resources would be released
	       when a new table model was applied to a table filter.               
	   </li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Version 2.1.2 ( 26th January 2010 ) </h3>
       <ul>
       <li>
	       Added a new singleton instance to facilitate updating the default settings
	       of the library (what can be achieved, anyway, using system properties).
       </li>
       
       <li>
	       Added an autoselection mode, enabled by default. If the current filtering
	       filters out all rows in the table but one, that row become automatically selected.
	       Likewise, selected rows are automatically de-selected when they are filtered out
	       (this is the usual operation mode in the Java 6 table sorter)
       </li>
       
       <li>
	       Modified the default behaviour of the filters, to use wildcard expressions when
	       the user does not specify any operator.
       </li>
       
       <li>
	       All the filter editor constructors where the filter position (table's column)
	       was specified, are now deprecated.
       </li>
       
       <li>
	       Solved bugs related to setting the header visible or hidden, and enabled or disabled
       </li>
      
       <li>
	       Added new Position type NONE, to ensure that the header is not automatically
	       placed -if that is so required-.
       </li>
     </ul>
      

    <h3>Version 2.0.1 ( 13th November 2009 ) </h3>
     <ul>
       <li>
	       This version is limited to defining properly the properties that
	       define the default behaviour. Although already partially included in
	       version 2.0.0, the inclusion was not complete and buggy in the case of
	       some of these properties.<br>
	       The full list of system properties that can be defined to override
	       the default TableFilter behavior is listed <a href='properties.html'>here</a>.
       </li>
       <li>
	       A new <a href='examples.html#AppTestProperties'>example</a> is provided to test the extended behaviour.
       </li>
     </ul>

    <h3>Version 2.0.0 ( 1st September 2009 ) </h3>
      <ul>
       <li>
       This version extends some public interfaces, adding functionality. However,
       it means that users that implemented their own table filter editors or text parsers 
       must now implement
       the new interfaces, so the compatibility is broken. Most users uniquely use the existing
       table filter editors and parsers, and will not face any compatibiliy issues:
       <ul>	
	        <li>
		        Changed interface on 
		        <a href="api/net/coderazzi/filters/gui/ITableFilterEditor.html">ITableFilterEditor</a>
		        <ul>
		            <li>It is possible to retrieve the applied filter on any table's column</li>
		            <li>It is also possible to set dynamically the filter on any column</li>
		            <li>Its is supported, through the use of the new 
		            <a href="api/net/coderazzi/filters/gui/ITableFilterEditorObserver.html">ITableFilterEditorObserver</a>
		            interface, to be notified of changes on the filter's editor.</li>
		        </ul>
	        </li>
	        <li>
		        Changed interface on 
		        <a href="api/net/coderazzi/filters/parser/IFilterTextParser.html">IFilterTextParser</a>,
		        including two methods already defined in the generic implementation in 
		        <a href="api/net/coderazzi/filters/parser/generic/FilterTextParser.html">FilterTextParser</a>:
		        <ul>
		            <li>Define a type builder for specific user types.</li>
		            <li>Define a comparator for any type.</li>
		        </ul>
	        </li>
	        <li>
		        Added interface on 
		        <a href="api/net/coderazzi/filters/gui/ITableFilterHeaderObserver.html">ITableFilterHeaderObserver</a>,
		        to observe events on the <a href="api/net/coderazzi/filters/gui/TableFilterHeader.html">TableFilterHeader</a>.
	        </li>
	        <li>
	        	Dates are now <a href='types.html#dates'>automatically handled</a> in the library.
	    	</li>
	        <li>
		        The user can provide properties that override some default behaviours. These properties
		        have been later redefined in 2.0.1.
	        </li>
	        <li>
		        Bug solved: usage of renderers on 
		        <a href="api/net/coderazzi/filters/gui/editors/TableChoiceFilterEditor.html">TableChoiceFilterEditor</a> 
		        would likely drive to AWT exceptions.
	        </li>
	        <li>
		        Bug solved: changing the table or the model, using the 
		        <a href="api/net/coderazzi/filters/gui/editors/TableChoiceFilterEditor.html">TableChoiceFilterEditor</a>
		        on a column with boolean or enumeration types, would hide all the elements, as if they would not
		        validate the filter -even if empty-
	        </li>
	        <li>
	        	<a href="api/net/coderazzi/filters/UserFilter.html">UserFilter</a>s are automatically enabled
	    	</li>
	        <li>
		        Extended examples to show how to listen for events on the table editors
	        </li>
       </ul>
       </li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Version 1.5.0 ( 7th August 2009 ) </h3>
      <ul>
       <li>Changes; this release improves on the usage of the 
       <a href="api/net/coderazzi/filters/gui/editors/TableChoiceFilterEditor.html">TableChoiceFilterEditor</a>,
          that is, the editor filter that offers the user a list of the different options
          as found in the table model:
       <ul>

        <li>The choices are automatically updated when new entries are included in the table.
        That is, new values are added to the filter's choices; however, old values, that
        are removed or replaced out of the table model, are not removed from the filter's choices.
        </li>
        <li>In addition, the comparator function used to set the order among the choices in
        the editor, is replaced, to use automatically the comparison method supplied on
        <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html">Comparable classes</a>
         (if supplied, that is)</li>
       </ul>
      </li></ul>

  	<h3>Version 1.4.1 ( 4th July 2009 ) </h3>
      <ul>
       <li>Changes:
       <ul>
       	<li>Bug solution: in specific conditions, the header would fail to display.</li>
       	<li>Bug solution: filters could be added to the default TableFilterHeader, but it would be needed to
       	invoke reportFilterUpdatedToObservers(), a protected method: therefore, clients had to be defined
       	as separate classes. Adding now a user filter triggers automatically the report method.</li>
       	<li>Added commodity class UserFilter to create external filters.</li>
       	<li>Added serialization ids to all serializable classes.</li>
       </ul>
      </li></ul>

  	<h3>Version 1.4.0 ( 10th June 2009 ) </h3>
      <ul>
       
       <li>Changes:
       <ul>
       	<li>The whole namespace is migrated from byteslooser.com to coderazzi.net</li>
       	<li>Removing Java compilations warnings from source.</li>
       </ul>
      </li></ul>

  	<h3>Version 1.3.0 ( 17th February 2009 ) </h3>
      <ul>
       <li>Changes:
       <ul>
       	<li>Automatic layout management for the filter header.
	       	On previous versions, the user had to place manually the header in the Gui container, 
	      as detailed <a href="header.html#manual">here</a>, while now is is enough to
	      instantiate the header and set the associated table: 
		    <pre>TableFilterHeader filterHeader = new TableFilterHeader(table);</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
	      Version 1.3.0 keeps backwards compatibility: if the 
	      <a href="api/net/coderazzi/filters/gui/TableFilterHeader.html">TableFilterHeader</a>
	      is explicitely included in some Gui container, the default behaviour to 
	      automatically setup the filter header close by the table header is deactivated.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li></ul>
