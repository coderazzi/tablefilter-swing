  <h1><a name='version'>Version</a></h1>

    <p>Current version is 1.3.0, released the 17th February 2008.</p>
    
    <p>1.3.0 introduces automatic layout management for the filter header. 
      On previous versions, the user had to place manually the header in the Gui container, 
      as detailed <a href='header.html#manual'>here</a>, while now is is enough to
      instantiate the header and set the associated table:
    </p> 
    
    <pre>TableFilterHeader filterHeader = new TableFilterHeader(table);</pre>
    
    <p>
      Version 1.3.0 keeps backwards compatibility: if the 
      <a href='api/com/byteslooser/filters/gui/TableFilterHeader.html'>TableFilterHeader</a>
      is explicitely included in some Gui container, the default behaviour to 
      automatically setup the filter header close by the table header is deactivated.

     <p>
       The source distribution contains, in addition to the 
      library's source code, some tests. These tests make usage of
      a general icon library (FamFamFam), and, in case of the Java 1.5 
      version, of a open source class called TableSorter.java, which 
      retains the original copyright.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As of version 1.2.0, there are also icons in the library, to facilitate
      its usage under Gui editors. These icons come from the 
      <a href='http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/'>FamFamFam</a> silk icon library, 
      licensed under a
      <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 License</a>.
